Build a loan calculator that takes three inputs:
1. loan amount
2. APR
3. loan duration

Calculate monthly payment based on this formula:

m = p * (j / (1 - (1+j)**(-n)))

where m = monthly payment
p = loan amount
j = monthly interest rate
n = loan duration in months

INPUT
loan amount
APR in percent
loan duration in years

Output monthly payment (and also input variables)

Calculate monthly interest rate from APR
Calculate loan duration in months based on loan duration in years
Verify all inputs

100000, 5, 5 => 1887.12
100000, 30, 5 => 3235.34
250000, 30.5, 2.5 => 1,342.05

2. APR
   - APR must be a number (no characters other than '.' allowed)

   - return APR
4. Get loan duration in years
   - ask user loan duration in years
   - get user input
   - print error message if input is invalid and try again
   - return loan duration in years
5. Calculate monthly interest rate
   - apr / 12
6. Calculate loan duration in months
   - loan duration in years * 12
7. Calculate monthly payment
   - input monthly interest rate, loan amount, duration in months
   - calculate monthly payment based on formula
   - return monthly payment
8. Print results
9. Ask user if they would like to make another calculation
   - get user input
   - break unless they want to try again
10. Goodbye message
